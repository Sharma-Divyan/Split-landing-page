The Split Landing Page is a modern and visually engaging web design layout that divides the screen into two interactive sections â€” typically used to showcase two contrasting options, products, or calls to action.

Each side of the page features its own content (image, title, button, etc.) and responds dynamically to mouse hover, smoothly expanding one side while shrinking the other. This creates a clean and intuitive user experience that encourages interaction and decision-making.
